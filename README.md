Library Management System Project Overview
Project Description: The Library Management System is a Python-based project that aims to automate the management of a library's collection of books. The system allows librarians to add, remove, borrow, and return books, as well as display the current status of all books in the library.

Key Features:

Book Management: Add, remove, borrow, and return books from the library's collection.
Book Status: Display the current status of all books in the library, including their title, author, publication year, and availability.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive menu-based interface for librarians to interact with the system.
Project Goals:

Efficient Book Management: Automate the process of managing books in the library, reducing manual errors and increasing productivity.
Improved User Experience: Provide a user-friendly interface for librarians to easily interact with the system and manage books.
Scalability: Design the system to accommodate a growing library collection and user base.
Technical Requirements:

Programming Language: Python 3.x
Data Storage: In-memory data storage (lists and dictionaries)
User Interface: Menu-based interface using Python's built-in input/output functions
Project Structure:

library_management_system.py: The main Python script containing the system's logic and functionality.
Book class: Represents a book in the library, with attributes for title, author, publication year, and status.
Library class: Represents the library itself, with methods for adding, removing, borrowing, and returning books.
Future Enhancements:

Database Integration: Replace in-memory data storage with a database management system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) for improved scalability and data persistence.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to the system and ensure data security.
Web-Based Interface: Develop a web-based interface using a framework like Flask or Django to provide remote access to the system.
